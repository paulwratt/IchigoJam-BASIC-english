IchigoJam BASIC 0.6～

-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
Obtain input of IN terminal.

[Command format]
IN([<terminal>])

[Example]
LET A,IN(1)
A=IN()

[Commentary]
When <terminal> is omitted The state of IN1 - 4 is represented by 1, 2, 4, 8.
In this case the return value is from 0 to 15.

When attaching <terminal>, the range of <terminal> is 1 to 4, and the return value is 0 or 1.
Commands with <terminal> are valid after 0.8.7.
IN1 and 2 and 4 has resistance. (Pulled down to 1.0.0 beta 6, pulled up from 1.0.0 beta 7)
BTN has resistor R3 (1 MΩ). Note that IN 3 has no resistance.

1.0.0 beta 3 ~ 1.1 Beta 4 treats BTN as IN5.
When <terminal> is omitted, it is represented by 16, and when adding <terminal> it is 5.

In 1.1 beta 5 and later, by specifying OUT 1, -1 to OUT 4, -1
Assign the OUT1 to OUT4 terminals to IN5 to IN8.
<Terminal> When it is omitted, it becomes 16, 32, 64, 128, and when attaching <terminal> it becomes 5 to 8.
BTN is changed to IN9 handling, and when attaching <terminal> is 9.
1.1 beta 5 returns BTN operation with IN() in 32, there is a problem in operation.

In 1.1 beta 6 and later, by specifying OUT 5, -1 and OUT 6, -1
Assign the OUT 5 to OUT 6 terminals to IN 10 to IN 11.
<Terminal> When 512 and 1024 is omitted, it becomes 10 to 11 when attaching <terminal>.

It corresponds to the pull-up input by designation of OUT 5, -2 etc. from 1.2 beta 43.

SkyBerryJAM also has IN1 and IN4 buttons.
KumaJam also has an IN1 button.
Pressing these buttons will change the value of IN.
Unlike BTN, be careful that 1, push to 0 after separating.

IchigoJam BASIC RPi has no body button in Raspberry Pi,
Instead of the BTN terminal, it is treated as an independent IN9 terminal.

IchigoJam web · IchigoJam Returns 0 if the IN terminal does not physically exist such as PC.
Please be careful when considering the button with the IN terminal.

Depending on IN2 version, BTN and OUT1 ~ 4 (IN 5 ~ 8)
The state of the voltage can be obtained finely. (Analog input)
