Stop processing for the specified time.
<time> is about 1 second in NTSC version, about 1 second by 50 in PAL version,
The range is from 1 to 32767. (NTSC version in Japan, PAL version is from 1.2.2)
Added since 1.1 beta4, It is affected by VIDEO clock down.
With VIDEO 0,10 then WAIT 60 will be about 10 seconds.

By putting 0 in <dive> from 1.2 beta 7,

IchigoJam BASIC RPi does not support Deep Sleep.
