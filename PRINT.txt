PRINT <number> [;]

? "HI!
LOCATE 0,-1:?"on UART ";:?A

[Commentary]
If it is a character string, enclose it in ".
If it becomes a newline after that, the trailing " can be omitted.
If you attach a semicolon (;) at the end, it is possible to concatenate.
If you do not add a ";"
On the bottom line, scroll up one line.
It is possible to use "?" Instead of PRINT.

When serial connection is made, it is output as it is.

When the vertical position is set to -1 in LOCATE (for example, LOCATE 0, -1)
It does not output screen output, but only serial output.
It corresponds from 0.9.4.
