It returns the state that the key of the body button keyboard is pushed.

[Command format]
BTN([<value>])

[Example]
PRINT BTN()
I = BTN(SPACE)

[Commentary]
Returns 1 if the button is pressed, 0 if not pressed.
From 1.0.0 beta 6, analog detection is possible on the BTN terminal. See ANA.
It corresponds to BTN(<value>) from 1.0.0 beta9.
<value> is UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT SPACE 0.
Unlike INKEY(), you get the current key state which is not affected by the key buffer.
0 is the body button as when omitted.

BTN() and BTN(0) are valid only for IchigoJam BASIC where the body button exists.

1.0.0 beta 3 to 1.1 beta 4, and 1.0.2 beta 3 to 11
The BTN terminal is also assigned to IN5.
In 1.1 beta 5 and later, the BTN terminal is assigned to IN9.
See also IN.

Besides BTN, SkyBerryJAM also has IN1 and IN4 buttons.
In addition to BTN, KumaJam also has an IN1 button.
It is possible to obtain the value with the IN command together.
