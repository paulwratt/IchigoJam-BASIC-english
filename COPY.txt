[Function]
Copy the contents of the virtual memory area.

[Command format]
COPY <area destination>, <area source>, <number of transfers>

[Example]
COPY #880,#800,5

[Commentary]
From <source> of virtual memory area to <destination>
<Number of forwarding> Performs byte transfer.
<Source> → <destination>, <destination> + 1 → <destination> + 1, ...
I will copy it.
For example, fill the full screen with the strawberry mark in the following cases.

CLP: POKE #900,255: COPY #901,#900,767

From 1.2 beta 21, you can use minus value for <transfer count>.
If you set <transfer count> to minus, copy from the end.
1.2 beta 23 or later <area source> <area destination> specifies the end of the area.
This is the start position of the copy.
1.2 beta 21 to 22 have specified the head of the area, but changed.
