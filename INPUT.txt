[Commentary]
You will be prompted to enter a number until Enter (return) is entered.
The entered numerical value enters <variable>.
If there is <character string>, it will display and continue input.
If there is not,? Is displayed.

If a character or symbol other than numbers is entered in the input, it will not result in an error,
After the letters other than numbers in the head are ignored (even if there are numbers).
If there are no digits in the head, 0 is returned if nothing is entered.

Normally you will enter from the keyboard,
When serial connection is performed, input from serial is accepted.

From 1.2 beta 3 it is handled as a character string by enclosing with "",
Returns the starting address of the string.
Since this address is returned from the screen position #900 to #BFF,
Please note that you lose the character string when scrolling.
