[Function]
Get value from virtual address area.

[Command format]
PEEK (<number>)

[Example]
PEEK(#E0*8)

[Commentary]
#000 to #FFF are effective for <number>.
Between #000 and #100F is valid from 1.1 beta 8.

The following are valid in 0.9.9 - RC 6 or later.
Some characters such as character patterns are effective before that.

Change of character pattern corresponds to <address> #000 to #7FF,
Pattern code 0 (#00) to 255 (#FF) patterns can be acquired.
Eight addresses (+0 to +7) are composed of one character from character code number ×8.
It entered from the top in the order of the youngest of the numbers.
Unlike POKE, all character codes can be acquired.

Arrays and variables correspond to <address> #800 to #8FF.
The most significant bit is the sign bit in the order of the lower 8 bits and the upper 8 bits.
Continuing from #800 to #801 for [0], #802 to #803 for [1] ..., up to [101] for #8CA to #8CB,
Subsequently, variables #8CC to #8CD are from variable A and become variable Z for #8FE to #8FF.

The screen display character corresponds to #900 to #BFF.
#900 is a character code with abscissa 0 and ordinate 0, followed by the character code,
It is up to the abscissa (x-axis) 31 and the ordinate (y-axis) 23 of #BFF.

The program corresponds to #C00 - #1001.
(From #1000 to #1001 from 1.1 beta 8)
Line number 2 address (lower 8 bits, upper 8 bits in this order),
After the character number 1 address (including the end code)
The program itself excluding the line number is entered.
The end code is #00 and 1 byte,
If the next address is odd, add another byte #00.
As a result, the line number is always made to be an even number.
When it becomes 1023 to 1024 bytes, the end code enters #1000 to #1001,
1.1 beta 8 and later can detect this.

The key status corresponds to #1002 to #100F. (From 1.1 beta 8)
#1002 Arrow key · Space key status (1 ← · 2 → · 4 ↑ · 8 ↓ ·)
#1003 Number in key buffer
#1004 ~ Key Buffer

When entering machine language, machine language body,
Or you can get PEEK as value acquisition result of USR.
Because IchigoJam PC has different CPU, USR can not be used.
