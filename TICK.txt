[Commentary]
When IchigoJam is executed, it is always in the count state,
In the NTSC version, it advances by 1/60 seconds. It is about 60 at about 1 second.
In the PAL version, it advances by 1 in about 1/50 second. It is about 1 second with 50.
The PAL version is supported from 1.2.2. It is NTSC version in Japan.
When VIDEO is set to 0, counting is not performed while it is not displayed.
Next to 16383 (#3FFF), it returns to 0.
1.0.0 beta 10 is changed to 0 after 32767 (#7FFF).
Even in clock down mode of VIDEO from 1.1 beta 4
Please be aware that it will be affected.
When it is set to VIDEO 1,10 then the values of TICK()  becomes 10 seconds instead 60 seconds.

Up to 0.9.7 is reset to 0 by RUN etc.,
It is also possible to reset to 0 using CLT.
Since 0.9.8 is no longer reset by RUN etc.
To reset, you need to use CLT.
