FILES
IchigoJam BASIC 1.0.0～
IchigoJam BASIC RPi
IchigoJam PC 0.1 beta 5～
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
The program list is displayed.

[Command format]
FILES [[<start file number>,] <end file number>] (1.1.0 -)
FILES [<Maximum number of files>] (~ 1.0.2)

[Example]
FILES
FILES 0, 163 (1.1 beta ~)
FILES 68 (~ 1.0.2)

[Commentary]
IchigoJam main unit, including EEPROM when EEPROM is connected
List the programs.

After the existing program number,
It displays characters after the command in the first line of the program.
'If you put a comment in the comment will be displayed so it is convenient.

In the case of EEPROM of 512 K and 1024 K bits
Except for some EEPROMs, they are displayed completely.
For the 32K to 256K bits the same program
Please be careful to display with multiple program numbers.
Because there is a difference in the access of I2C for EEPROM of 16 K bit or less,
It can not be used for saving programs.


1.0.1 · 1.0.2 (including beta 12)
<maximum number of files> can be set for the number of files.
From 1.1 beta (including 1.0.2 beta 11)
The file is displayed in the range from <start file number> to <end file number>.
For FILES only, display only the main body, FILES 0 will show everything including EEPROM.
, You can also specify only <end file number> without removing.
FILES 110 will be the same as FILES 0, 110.


For 1.0.1 · 1.0.2 beta,
Specify the maximum number of files that can be displayed when all files exist.
For 8, it is 0 to 3 and 100 to 103, it is a maximum of 8 files.
Specifically, it is as follows.

     8 = 103 (32 Kbits)
  9~12 = 107 (64 Kbits)
    20 = 115 (128 Kbits)
    36 = 131 (256 Kbits)
    68 = Up to 163 (512 Kbits)
     0 = Show all

You can also display 1 page, 2 page, 3 page as 22, 44, 66.

If there is no file, it will be hidden,
Since this is also counted,
Please be aware that it may be displayed less than the specified number of files.


In the range designation from 1.1 beta, Ideal display is made as follows.
(When 512K or less is assumed for A2 = GND connection)

    Body only = FILES or FILES 0, 3
     32 Kbits = FILES 103 or FILES 0, 103
     64 Kbits = FILES 107 or 0, 107
    128 Kbits = FILES 115 or 0, 115
    256 Kbits = FILES 131 or 0, 131
    512 Kbits = FILES 163 or 0, 163
    All Display = FILES 0 or FILES 0, 227


FILES 0, 0 are treated the same as FILES 0 until 1.2.3, and all are displayed.
1.2.4 · 1.2b56 · 1.2b20 From RPi,
FILES 0 and 20 only show program number 0.
For IoT compatible version, only 0 is displayed in case of FILES from 1.2b59 IoT.


IchigoJam PC tries to display up to 227,
Actually you can only use 0 to 3.

IchigoJam BASIC RPi is 0 to 3 and 100 to 227 to 1.2b15 RPi and 1.2.4 RPi.
(micro) Refer to the file in the files directory of the SD memory card.
It became 0 to 227 from 1.2b16 RPi and 1.2.5 RPi.
0 to 99 are SD memory cards, 100 to 227 refer to EEPROM.
If omitted, the same applies to FILES 0 and 3 up to 1.2.4 RPi and 1.2b19 RPi,
For 1.2b20 RPi and 1.2.5 RPi and later, FILES 0 and 20 are the same.
