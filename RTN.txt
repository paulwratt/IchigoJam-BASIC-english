[Commentary]
After executing the subroutine flying in GOSUB,
It is used to return to the original main routine.
If RETURN is executed while GOSUB is not being used, an error occurs.

Abbreviated RTN can be used from 1.1.0 beta 1.
In 1.0.2 beta 10 to 11, the abbreviation was RT, but this has been abolished.

RTN is an alias for RETURN.
