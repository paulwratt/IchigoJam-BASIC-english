[Function]
Returns the character being pressed.

[Command format]
INKEY()

[Example]
PRINT INKEY()

[Commentary]
Returns the character code of the keyboard being pressed.
If it is not pressed, 0 is returned.

1.2 If beta 19 gets CHR$(0) from serial,
It returns 256 (#100).

In other models, the return value as INKEY$ returns the character itself,
In IchigoJam, variables are numbers, so they are in code.
If you want to use letters please use ASC together.

10 I=INKEY(): IF I<>ASC("0") GOTO 10

For example above, wait until 0 key is pressed (until you get 0 from serial).

The special codes are as follows.

    10 · Enter (return)
    28 · LEFT ← (left)
    29 · RIGHT → (right)
    30 · UP ↑ (upper)
    31 · DOWN ↓ (bottom)

10 I = INKEY(): IF I<>10 GOTO 10

Wait for the above until Enter key is pressed.

Successive key inputs are stored in the key buffer and sequentially fetched by INKEY().
Auto-repeat is effective when long pressed.
For game operation purposes this may result in unintended behavior.
The key buffer can be cleared using CLK. See CLK.
Also, by using BTN(<value>) instead of INKEY()
You can get the current key state unaffected by the key buffer. Please refer to BTN.
