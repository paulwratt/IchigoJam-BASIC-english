# IchigoJam
FYI _ichigo_ means _strawberry_ in Japanese, hence _ IchigoJam_ makes sense, and [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) is you friend.

[IchigoJam](https://ichigojam.net/) is a now a collection of small electronics boards, similar to RPi + HAT boards. The cpu is an _armv6_ LPC1114FN28. They were created with an education program to help kids in Japan "get into electronic early", not just computers.

The boards are very popular, even with adaults, as the IchigoJam BASIC is almost identical to MSX-BASIC. Besides the basic LED and sensor examples one of the first things they get into is small robotics.

For adults the "next step up" in hardware is the RPi, as most of the IchigoJam daughter boards can also be connected to the user SPI pins on the RPi. They eventually created [IchicoJam BASIC for RPi](https://ichigojam.github.io/RPi/) _and_ PC.
