If you specify only one line number without appending, you have specified <end line>
The specified line is displayed from the beginning.

From 1.2 beta 19, if only <end line> is not attached, only that line is displayed.
1.2 beta From 20 - <end line> and if it is minus <end line> will be displayed.
<starting line>, If it is 0, it displays <starting line> and after.
From 1.2 beta 43 the display target is set to line number 16384.
1.2 When beta 44 sets <end line> to 0,
If 16385 or more is entered in <start line>, it displays up to the last line including 16385 onwards.
