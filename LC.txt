LOCATE
IchigoJam BASIC
IchigoJam BASIC RPi
IchigoJam PC
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
Specify the position of the character to be displayed.

[Command format]
LOCATE <abscissa>, <ordinate>
LC <abscissa>, <ordinate> (0.8.9 ~)

[Example]
LOCATE 3,3
LC 5,5 (0.8.9 ~)

[Commentary]
<abscissa> = <x-axis>
<ordinate> = <y-axis>
<vertical coordinate> = <ordinate> = <y-axis>

The display range is 0.9.8, <abscissa> is 0 to 35, <vertical coordinate> is 0 to 26,
After 0.9.9, <abscissa> is 0 to 31, <vertical coordinate> is 0 to 23,
IchigoJam BIG published at 1.2.0
<abscissa> is 0 to 15, and <vertical coordinate> is 0 to 11.
However, even if it exceeds this value it will not result in an error, and move the cursor to the rightmost or bottommost point.

Initially, <abscissa> is 0 to 36,
Maintaining this firmware
The possibility that IchigoJam is used is very low.

LC can be used instead of LOCATE. (0.8.9 ~)

Serial connection is 1.1.0 or later,
LOCATE can be reflected by using the corresponding application.

By setting the <ordinate> to -1, it does not output to the video input screen,
It outputs only to the serial port. It corresponds from 0.9.4.
