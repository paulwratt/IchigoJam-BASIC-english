IchigoJam PC not compatible
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
Call machine language.

[Command format]
USR(<address>, <value>)
USR(<address>, <value>, <character pattern>) (1.1 beta 6 ~)
USR(<address>, <value>, <character pattern>, <character pattern top>) (1.1 beta 10 ~)

[Example]
? USR(#700,100)

[Commentary]
Execute machine language from <address> address.
<value> can be acquired from the first parameter (machine language to R0 register).
Since the value of the R0 register is returned as the return value,
It is possible to use it with LET or PRINT.
In case of making with C you can get it with the first parameter and return it with return.

From 1.1 beta 6 as the second parameter (R1 register)
Pass the start pointer of virtual memory (corresponding address of #000 part).
However, this value can not be changed Virtual address of <character pattern>
The #000 to #6FF part actually does not exist. # 700 or later is valid.

From 1.1 beta 10 as the third parameter (R2 register)
Pass the top address of the <character pattern> (corresponding address of #000 part).
Here, #000 to #6FF is effective.

Up to 1.1 beta 5

    int16_t sample (int16_t val) {

        /* Main */

        return val;
    }

1.1 beta 6 or later

    int16_t sample (int16_t val, char * mem) {

        /* Main */

        return val;
    }


Where to place machine language
· #700 to #7FF Changing character pattern
· #800 to #8FF array and variable
· #C00 to #FFF program body (1.1 beta 10 ~)
You can use.

Characters and arrays / variables after CHR$(224)
Please be careful to destroy the program itself.

IchigoJam BASIC and IchigoJam BASIC RPi (Raspberry Pi)
There are differences depending on CPU's difference.

IchigoJ amd RPi A/A+/B/B+/0/0+W support Thumb
RPi 2B+/3/3+ support Thumb 2

IchigoJam PC does not work. It returns Syntax Error.
