[Command format]
CLK

[Example]
CLK

[Commentary]
When several keys are input,
(Especially when the key repeat occurs with keeping the key pressed)
Since the input is stored in the key buffer
It may adversely affect input acceptance such as INKEY () or INPUT.
By clearing it with CLK, we can deal with this problem.
