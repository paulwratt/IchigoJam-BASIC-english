[Function]
Ignore the contents described after this.

[Command format]
REM <comment>
'<comment>

[Example]

[Commentary]
All character strings after REM are treated as comments and are ignored.
Even if you enter a command separated by ":" it is treated as a comment and is ignored.
By using this, for commands not to be temporarily executed,
It is possible to put REM in the head and ignore it.

You can use ' instead of REM.
