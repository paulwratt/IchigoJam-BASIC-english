-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
Put a value in the virtual address area.

[Command format]
POKE <address>, <value> [, <value>] [, ...]

[Example]
POKE #E0*8,#FF
POKE #E0*8,#FF,#81,#81,#81,#81,#81,#81,#FF
POKE #700,#01,#1C,#00,#20,#40,#18,#01,#39,#FC,#D1,#70,#47

[Commentary]
<address> is #700 to #FFF, <value> is #00 to #FF,
<value> can be described consecutively.

The following are valid in 0.9.9 - RC 6 or later.
Some characters such as character patterns are effective before that.

Changes to the character pattern correspond with <address> #700 to #7FF.
(You can not change #000 to #6 FF)
You can change character codes 224 (#E0) to 255 (#FF).
Eight addresses (+0 to +7) are composed of one character from character code number ×8.
I entered from the top in the order of the youngest of the numbers.

Arrays and variables correspond to <address> #800 to #8FF.
The most significant bit is the sign bit in the order of the lower 8 bits and the upper 8 bits.
Continuing from #800 to #801 for [0], #802 to #803 for [1] ..., up to [101] for #8CA to #8CB,
Subsequently, variables #8CC to #8CD are from variable A and become variable Z for #8FE to #8FF.

The screen display character corresponds to #900 to #BFF.
#900 is a character code with abscissa 0 and ordinate 0, followed by the character code,
It is up to the abscissa (x-axis) 31 and the ordinate (y-axis) 23 of #BFF.
IchigoJam BIG is #900 to #9BF and has abscissa 15 and ordinate 11 of #9BF.
Unlike PRINT, when updating this area, it will not be output serially.

The program corresponds to #C00 - #FFF.
Line number 2 address (lower 8 bits, upper 8 bits in this order),
After character number 1 address (including end code 0)
The program itself excluding the line number is entered.
0 is entered as the end code of the line.
If the next address is an odd number, enter 1 byte 0 again,
The line number should be an even number.

Machine language is also supported. It can be executed with USR.
Region can be changed character pattern, array / variable,
Please use the free space part of the program.
IchigoJam PC is different CPU, so USR can not be used,
POKE is not available.
