LOAD
IchigoJam BASIC 0.8.0～
IchigoJam BASIC RPi
IchigoJam PC 0.1 beta 5～
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
Load the program.

[Command format]
LOAD [<program number>]

[Example]
LOAD
LOAD 20

[Commentary]
Programs currently loaded by IchigoJam are erased,
It is changed to the program loaded by LOAD.

The value of <program number> is 0 to 2 or 0 to 3 and
It is 100 to 226 or 100 to 227.

IchigoJam main body is 0 to 2 up to 0.9.9,
It corresponds to 1.0 to 0 to 3. (Including IchigoJam PC)
When omitted, it is 0 up to 0.9.8,
It becomes the program number which accessed latest from 0.9.9.
The IoT compatible version is only 1.2b59 IoT and the body is only saved 0.
If omitting it immediately after startup, read 0.

From 0.9.3, save to external EEPROM. 100 to 226 is valid.
Values ​​from 100 to 227 are valid from 0.9.9 RC.
Valid values ​​vary depending on the EEPROM capacity and wiring.
The program number that can not be used is File Error.

EEPROM can be used with 32K to 1024K bits,
When using 1024 K bits at 0.9.9 and
Contents can be completely used except some EEPROM.
For the 32K to 256K bits the same program
Please be careful to refer with multiple program numbers.
Because there is a difference in the access of I2C for EEPROM of 16K bit or less,
It can not be used for saving programs.

IchigoJam BASIC RPi is 0 to 3 and 100 to 227 to 1.2 b 15 RPi · 1.2.4 RPi.
(micro) Read from the file in the files directory of the SD memory card.
It became 0 to 227 from 1.2b16RPi · 1.2.5RPi.
0 to 99 are SD memory cards, 100 to 227 are read from EEPROM.

If there is no program in the program number (SAVE with NEW)
It will not result in an error, it will be OK display.

You can load and execute immediately. See LRUN.

Technically, 1 Kbyte area of ​​the main body and EEPROM
It is copied to virtual address area #C00 ~ #FFF.
For this reason, POKE puts in a vacant area of ​​the program (area behind #FFF) with a value
Save this value including SAVE,
After LOAD or LRUN this value can be retrieved with PEEK.
