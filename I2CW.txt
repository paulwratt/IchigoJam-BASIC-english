-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
The value put in memory
It sends it to the device connected by the I2C serial bus

[Command format]
<return value> = I2CW(<I2C address>, <command start address>, <command length>, <write memory start address>, <write memory length>)
<return value> = I2CW(<I2C address>, [<command start address>, <command length>,] <write memory start address>, <write memory length>) (1.2b42 ~)

[Example]
R = I2CW(`1010000,#700,2,#702,16)
R = I2CW(`1010000,#700,16) (1.2 b 42 -)

[Commentary]
<I2C address> is a device that sends information via I2C.
Depending on the connection of the A0 to A2 terminals to the I2C device
It has a unique slope address. Specify this.
Values ​​range from 0 to 127 (`0000 000 to `1111 111).
Add WRITE of READ / WRITE bit to this and transmit.
Please note that it does not include the READ / WRITE bit.

After that, the command at <command length> from <command start address>
From <writing memory starting address> to <writing memory length>
Send the data.
<command start address> <writing memory starting address> is
This is the memory location containing the value to pass from IchigoJam.
<command length> <write memory length> indicates the length in bytes.
We will send the data in I2CW after putting in the value in advance with POKE.

I2C which had been adopted until 1.0.0 beta 2
For 1.0.0 beta 3 it was changed to I2CR and this I2CW.
Change the program that used I2C,
Please divide the command using VER().

By pressing the Esc key at 1.0.0 beta 11
It is now possible to interrupt transmission and reception.

From 1.2b42, with <command start address> and <command length> 
You can now omit it.
This allows you to separate commands and data
You can now send out.
