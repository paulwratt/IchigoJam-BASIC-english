[Command format]
CLEAR
CLV

[Example]
CLEAR
CLV

[Commentary]
Up to 0.9.3 variables and arrays were initialized at the stage of RUN,
0.9.4 is now maintained without being initialized.
As a result, when another program is executed by LRUN from the program
Variables and arrays can now be inherited.
It is also possible to set and inherit variables and arrays in direct mode.
Therefore, initialization of variables and arrays is specified using CLEAR.

CLEAR is an alias for CLV.
