UART
IchigoJam BASIC 1.1.0～
IchigoJam BASIC RPi
IchigoJam PC
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
Set the output to serial

[Command format]
UART <mode 1>
UART <mode 1> [, <mode 2>] (1.1 beta 13 ~)

[Example]
UART 0
UART 1,0

[Commentary]
<mode 1> is as follows. The startup default is 2
for IchigoJam BASIC and IchigoJam BASIC RPi,
It is 0 in IchigoJam PC.

    0 Do not output
    1 Print only PRINT. Line feed code LF
        It will be close to the behavior before 1.0.
        In 1.1 beta 6 it works the same as UART 3.
        1.1 beta 7 has been restored to the previous specification.
    2 Outputs for PRINT, LOCATE, CLS, SCROLL. Line feed code LF
        Output the following code according to the command.
        LOCATE → CHR$(#15,#20+<X coordinate>,#20+<Y coordinate>)
        CLS → CHR$(#13,#0C)
        SCROLL → CHR$(#15,<cursor direction>)
            <cursor direction> is #1C=left, #1D=right, #1E=up, #1F=down
    3 Output only PRINT. Line feed code CR+LF, with buffer
        It is more effective than 1.1 beta 7.

Devices that control according to serial signals (such as PanCake) and In applications,
It is necessary to execute UART and change the sending from IchigoJam.

It corresponds to <mode 2> from 1.1 beta13.
It is as follows. The startup default is 1
for IchigoJam BASIC and IchigoJam BASIC RPi,
It is 0 in IchigoJam PC.

    0 Ignore sending from serial
    1 Normal operation (Valid when numerical values ​​other than described are specified)
    2 Ignore the ESC key
      Thus, when the ESC code is transmitted from the serial
      It prevents the program from being stopped.
    4 Convert CR to LF (1.2 beta 41 ~)
