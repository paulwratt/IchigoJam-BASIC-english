-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
We change the line number of the program.

[Command format]
RENUM [<start line number>]
RENUM [<start line number>] [, <increment>] (1.1 beta 11 ~)

[Example]
RENUM
RENUM 100

[Commentary]
When RENUM is executed, it changes to 10 line numbers.
<start line number> can be used from 0.9.8 RC 11. If omitted, it is from 10.
The line number of GOTO and GOSUB is not changed. It must be changed manually.
0.9.8 From RC 6, lines that need to change line numbers are displayed.

1.1 <increment> is added from beta11 and increment of line number can be set.
The default is 10. Up to 1.1 beta 10 is fixed at 10.
