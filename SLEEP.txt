IchigoJam BASIC 0.7～
IchigoJam BASIC RPi not supported
IchigoJam PC
-----------------------------------------------------------
[Function]
Pauses program execution.

[Command format]
SLEEP

[Example]
SLEEP

[Commentary]
Execution of the program is stopped by SLEEP, and it waits for button input.
When IchigoJam's button is pressed, it returns to the IchigoJam startup state.
Since it will be a motion that completely reset (power OFF → ON)
Hold down the button a few seconds
(Starting from 1.0.0 beta and keeping it pressed even after BEEP sounds)
You can start program number 0.
Beginning with 1.0.0 beta 16, always start the program number 0 after returning from SLEEP.
In this case, startup display is no longer performed.

IchigoJam BASIC RPi does not work at all.
